The above github repository has the code for predicting gestational diabetes in a pregnant lady. The PIMA dataset is used for the training and testing the model. The brief description of above files:
- ML_model.py - This script contains the Machine learning model that is trained on the dataset.
- RF_hyperparametes_tuning.py - As the Random Forest performs best out of all the ML algos, this script tunes the RF hyperparameters to increase the accuracy ofthe model.
- flowchart.py - This script contains the code to create a flowchart of the ML model proposed in the study.
- NN_predictions.py - This script contains the proposed Neural Net model to predict GDM.

The CNN folder contains the NN model from another author. We ran it to compare our NN model's performance results. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Asirwad/Diabetes-Prediction-on-PIMA-dataset-using-CNN/)
